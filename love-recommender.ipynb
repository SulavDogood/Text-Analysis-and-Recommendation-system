The vectorizer combines these metrics to create a numerical representation for each document. Words that appear frequently within a document but are rare across the corpus receive higher values, emphasizing their significance. This numerical representation is essential for machine learning tasks involving text, such as document classification and information retrieval, as it captures the relative importance of words in distinguishing and analyzing documents."

      "heres the short version i want a girlfriend i have basically nothing but time on my hands but i dont need anymore attention than you feel like giving im a nice guy i like to share and make my friends happy i grow the best buds and smoke them everyday im not lazy and im always down for a new and exciting adventure feel free to read my ramblings you should ask me ill tell you anything you want to know most peoples first impression is i look young immature or some other wrong assumption you should try getting to know me before you judge me youd be surprised dont go off my profile that i got stoned and typed up in minutes im a catch i know that because all my exs told me that and so did there friends i dont know know what to say to different myself from the dipshits on here but you should meet me i might just be able to restore some small faith in you for real men im not trying to be cynical but it seems like the only girls i would date on here are never interested even though those are normally the girls i date when not meeting off the internet i have standards and wont just settle for anything that comes my way that doesnt mean you have to be a model and fuck me all the time it simply means i want to be interested in someone more than for just a night i like hearing horror stories from dates off of here sadly ive had more bad than good so far i dont get the point of trying to make your pictures look better than you really are its deceiving its not all about looks but there has to be mutual attraction if anything my pictures look worse or exactly like me most girls have said im a lot more handsome in person than my photos i enjoy looking good anyways im not just looking for sex and im not looking to get married within the next year or two i want to take things day by day if we like each other well keep talking to each other and if im talking to you then im not talking to any other girls i want some to go out and do things with seeing movies going out to dinner and such arent exactly the same by yourself im used to being in a relationship i was focusing on work taking a break now im starting to miss having someone to spend time with wake up next to go out with and have fun i want someone i can trust and be my friend and have mind blowing amazing sex too i can say without any ego if i want to i can easily give you the best sexual experience of your life sex without love is as meaningless as love without sex i dont lie im not a manwhore though seriously girls have told me theyve never orgasmed during sex i change that statement within minutes and then many times over i dont just fuck like a porn star im hung like one too i really enjoy giving pleasure and im great at it it makes me happy to make someone i like happy im down for just friends too all mine right now are in their s mostly married and some with kids besides the occasional weekend or playing golf none of them are too social i get out and do stuff by myself but its not usually half as fun if i knew anyone here closer to my age i probably wouldnt be on here about me i am moved out here to follow my dreams lived here two years now just moved into the city from oakland i plan on being in the bay area for quite a while till i have enough to move to europe i play golf every week with a few shots of jack daniels and a bowl or three of herb with some friends im going to go to college for agricultural studies right now i currently am growing medicine for local dispensaries id like to have a farm really a winery as well as my special garden im not some dipshit with a plant in his closet ive been studying how to grow since i was and have always planned on growing originally i was going to head up to canada but fuck that california is where its at im great at what i do and i work my ass off people think its as easy as water wait cut smoke well your wrong a lot goes into it and you need to know what your doing and have the time dedicated to do it if you want to make a living i take care of my plants like their my babies i support myself am my own boss i work my ass of at night and have all day to spend as i wish i consider myself lucky for being able to live of something i love and have a passion for instead of being stuck in some cubicle the rest of my life i feel like ive already said too much but lets just say i make enough to live and have an excellent time while living ill get the two negatives about me out of the way i smoke pot luckily it doesnt really affect me other than i feel fantastic i dont get retarded or lazy like some im skinny really if thats a negative fuck you oh and i mean that in the nicest way possible i eat like a fat ass i eat breakfast brunch lunch supper and dinner and someday soon my metabolism is going to catch up with me and i wont be able to eat innout burger and ben and jerrys everyday stick with me till then and i have an even sexier body having a good time being alive gardening cooking kissing relaxing my eyes or that im skinny hunter s thompson the man movies good ones im a huge movie buff way too many to list if i had to choose it would be between slaughter house clockwork orange and drstrangelove
